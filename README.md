# UoWDH-WebDD-Guide
A Website Design and Development Guide for Digital Humanities Projects

## Summary
The purpose of this document is to provide a baseline guide to any of the web design and development projects for University of Warwick's Digital Humanities team. This document includes guides for Pre, While, and Post project to-dos, as well as tips, jargons, and links to useful resources. It is hoped that this document will serve as a template to any of the future projects.

## Pre-Project Initiation Stage
In this stage, it is important to understand what the project is, generally. This will provide a clear entry to the project (the history i.e. the story behind the project), what it does (or hoped to do), the impact of the project, and any other relevant questions that can help us better understand the context of the project. In this stage, we should seek to understand:
* The story behind the project
* The aim(s)
* The current development of the database
