# UoWDH-WebDD-Guide
A Website Design and Development Guide for Digital Humanities Projects

## Summary
The purpose of this document is to provide a baseline guide to any of the web design and development projects for University of Warwick's Digital Humanities team. This document includes guides for Pre, While, and Post project to-dos, as well as tips, jargons, and links to useful resources. It is hoped that this document will serve as a template to any of the future projects.

## Pre-Project Initiation Stage
In this stage, it is important to understand what the project is, generally. This will provide a clear entry to the project (the history i.e. the story behind the project), what it does (or hoped to do), the impact of the project, and any other relevant questions that can help us better understand the context of the project. In this stage, we should seek to understand:
* The story behind the project
* The aim(s)
* The current development of the database
* _add more_

## Project Initiation Stage
In this stage, it is important to ask the client to lay out everything that they want/need for the project. The table below illustrates the division of tasks between designing and developing the project in the initial stage:

Design	|	Development 
Colour preferences	| Number of pages required - Homepage, About Us, About Project etc.
Design preferences	| Functionality - Image slider, Featured image etc.



* Design
	* Site functionality i.e. what they want to include in the website, and how they want the site to behave:
		* [ ] How many pages to have (Home, About, etc)
		* [ ] For homepage - what they want to have on frontpage i.e. image slider, tag clouds, featured items etc.
		* [ ] 
* Development
